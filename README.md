# Color-detection-trackbar
Real time Color Detection using OpenCV trackbars
A beginner-friendly computer vision mini project that demonstrates real time color detection using OpenCV. This project uses HSV color space and interactive trackbars to dynamically select color ranges for object masking in an image

## Features
- Real time color detection using trackbars
- Interactive and highlighting of selected color areas
- Simple and clean code structure
- Perfect for learning OpenCV basics

## How it works
The script converts the input frame from BGR to HSV color space and allows users to dynamically set lower and upper bounds for Hue, Saturation, and Vlue using OpenCV trackbars. It creates a mask for the selected color range and displays the detected color regions.
